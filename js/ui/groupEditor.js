/**
 * The group editor is integrated into directiveEditor.js via the "GROUP" and
 * "HOST_GROUP" type branches. This module provides any additional group-specific
 * utilities if needed.
 *
 * Currently, GROUP/HOST_GROUP editing is handled entirely within directiveEditor.js
 * using the members textarea approach. This file is a placeholder for potential
 * future enhancements like:
 *   - Drag-and-drop member reordering
 *   - Add/remove individual members via buttons
 *   - Member auto-complete from known usernames

// No exports needed at this time — kept as a placeholder per the plan.
